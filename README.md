💰 2. Financial Loss Model
A predictive model that estimates financial damage based on attack parameters such as:
- Type of attack  
- Target industry  
- Resolution time  
- Number of affected users  

When a high-risk result is detected, the system recommends consulting Hima, the AI cybersecurity assistant, for guidance.

 🤖 3. Hima Chatbot (RAG-based Assistant)
Hima is your AI-powered cybersecurity expert.  
It uses Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to provide accurate, context-aware answers sourced directly from verified datasets — not hallucinations.  

Users can:
- Ask general cybersecurity questions  
- Seek business-specific recommendations  
- Get instant, actionable responses
